# This is my Etch-A-Sketch project for The Odin Project. This project utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The main objective of this project was to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch while applying my newfound DOM manipulation knowledge. 

# This project starts off with a 16 x 16 grid, and then when a user clicks the "Create a grid!" button, the program will prompt the user to enter a number and generate a new grid.

# Some of my biggest challenges were creating the initial grid and checking to see if the user input was a number.
